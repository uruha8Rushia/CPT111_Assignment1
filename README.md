## üîç Assignment Overview  
The objective of this assignment is to build a simple, interactive dictionary program in C++ that: 

- Reading and processing word-meaning pairs from an input file.
- Writing structured output to a dictionary file with indexed entries.
- Searching for specific words and displaying their meanings.
- Displaying the full contents of the dictionary file.
- Adding new word-meaning pairs into the dictionary.
- Offers word suggestions to help expand the dictionary.

## üí° Concepts Used  
This assignment demonstrates the use of foundational C++ programming techniques, including:

- **File Input/Output (I/O)**: Reading from and writing to files using `ifstream` and `ofstream`.
- **String Manipulation**: Parsing lines using tab characters to separate words and meanings.
- **Interactive Menu System**: Providing a loop-driven console menu using basic I/O and control structures.
- **Control Structures**: Applying `if`, `switch`, and `while` statements to drive the program logic.
- **Manual Data Management**: Simulating data structures without arrays by using repeated file reads and logical indexing.
- **User Input Validation**: Managing and verifying user inputs to ensure robust interaction.
